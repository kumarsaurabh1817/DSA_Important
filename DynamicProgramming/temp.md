Let's break down what happens with this recursive function and then analyze its time and space complexities.

### What the Code Does

This function computes the number of unique paths from a given cell (i, j) to the starting cell (0, 0) in a grid. The idea is that from any cell, you can only move up (decrementing **i**) or left (decrementing **j**). The recursion stops when it reaches (0, 0) (returning 1 path) or when it goes out of bounds (returning 0).

### Time Complexity (TC)

1. **Recursive Structure**:  
   For every call to `GetUniquePathsRecursion(i, j, m, n)`, the function makes **two recursive calls**:
   - One for `GetUniquePathsRecursion(i-1, j, m, n)` (moving up)
   - One for `GetUniquePathsRecursion(i, j-1, m, n)` (moving left)

2. **Recurrence Relation**:  
   If you denote the time complexity for a cell (i, j) as T(i, j), the recurrence can be expressed as:  
   \[
   T(i, j) = T(i-1, j) + T(i, j-1) + O(1)
   \]
   This relation is similar to the one that defines the binomial coefficients. In fact, the number of unique paths from (0,0) to (i,j) is given by the binomial coefficient \(\binom{i+j}{i}\).

3. **Exponential Blow-up Without Memoization**:  
   Without any caching (i.e., memoization), many subproblems are solved repeatedly. For example, the path count for a particular cell might be recomputed many times through different recursive branches.  
   - In the worst-case scenario (for a grid of size m√ón, with starting call at (m-1, n-1)), the total number of calls is roughly on the order of the sum of all binomial coefficients from 0 to (m-1)+(n-1).  
   - This leads to an **exponential time complexity**. A common way to express this is **O(2^(m+n))** (or O(2^(i+j)) in terms of the parameters).

**Summary for TC**:  
The time complexity of this naive recursive approach is **exponential**, approximately **O(2^(m+n))**.

### Space Complexity (SC)

1. **Recursion Depth**:  
   The space used is determined by the maximum depth of the recursion stack. In this function, the deepest possible path occurs when you make a series of recursive calls until you hit the boundary.  
   - Starting from (i, j), the maximum depth is when you make i calls in one direction and j calls in the other, which sums to about **i + j**.

2. **Auxiliary Space**:  
   Each recursive call uses a constant amount of extra space (for variables such as `Up` and `Left`), so the total auxiliary space is proportional to the maximum recursion depth.

**Summary for SC**:  
The space complexity is **O(m+n)** (or **O(i+j)** in terms of the parameters).

---

### Final Summary

- **Time Complexity**: **O(2^(m+n))**  
  The function has exponential time complexity because it makes two recursive calls per invocation and re-computes many overlapping subproblems.

- **Space Complexity**: **O(m+n)**  
  The maximum depth of the recursion stack is proportional to **m+n**, which determines the space used.

By understanding these complexities, you can see why a naive recursive solution like this is not efficient for larger grids. To improve it, one could use **memoization** or **dynamic programming** to store intermediate results and avoid redundant calculations.
